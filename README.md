# shl-quiz-app
This is a personal project where I learn how to build a React app with connection to an [external web API from the Swedish Hockey League](http://doc.openapi.shl.se/) with a node.js backend hosted using [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).

### Project origin
My partner works as a camera operator at SHL games and need to know the players' faces and numbers to be able to quickly frame them when needed for the TV-production. This quiz app helps him learn the faces and numbers of the players before the game and his career has thereby been amazingly and immensly boosted. (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━✨
